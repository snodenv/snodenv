## 🚀 **About Me**
I'm a passionate developer who turns **coffee into code** and **ideas into reality**. I love building scalable web apps, diving into system design, and contributing to open-source projects that make a difference.

- 🔭 Currently working on: **AI-powered productivity tools**  
- 🌱 Learning: **Rust, WebAssembly, and advanced GraphQL**  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once debugged a production bug using only `console.log` and pure willpower  
- 🎯 2026 Goal: Release 3 open-source packages with >1k stars combined
